This file is supposted to be/become the documentation of the tools shared by the DESY differential cross section analysis setup, the ttH analysis setup, and the inclusive (tt, Z, m_t from m_lb) setup.

Right now it is under construction.

Guidelines for the tools:

General:

- do not let your code produce compiler warnings!
- add any new class to src/classes.h and src/classes_def.xml
  if it is supposed to be used in the framework

These tools SOULD:

- implement functions used for general corrections
- be kept up to date by all groups
- be based on simple data types: (int, float, double)
- live in the ztop namespace
- use clear enums (or strings) for configuration
- come with a small documentation
- use clear names for member functions even if they are longer
- use std::exceptions for exiting due to errors
  accompanied by a std::cout or std::cerr. 
  (important for parallalization)
- use vectors instead of arrays wherever possible
- use floats for most of the operations
  they are sufficiently precise if you don't do excessive calculations


These tools SHOULD NOT:

- use data types that do not ship with any standard c++ compiler
  such as: pat::<whatever>, ztop::NTJet
  EXCEPTION: TH1D/TH2D (if needed TString), implemented Lorentzvectors
  from mathdefs.h (but try to avoid them)

- depend on other packages (even within TopAnalysis/*)

- perform any format specific read/write operations

- use strings in ANY performance sensitive operation



Tool description:

bTagBase:
  base class for calculating b-tag weights, retagging jets and
  filling efficiency histograms
